# Large Language Models (LLMs) 

![](resources/image8.gif)

This repository is a **coding-focused** collection of scripts, notebooks, and tools related to **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It covers practical aspects of working with LLMs, including fine-tuning, optimization, inference, and deployment.

---

## Topics Covered

###  **1. Working with Pretrained LLMs**
- Using **GPT**, **BERT**, **LLaMA**, and other models
- Implementing **text generation**, **summarization**, and **question answering**
- Using **transformers pipeline** for quick inference

###  **2. Tokenization & Preprocessing**
- WordPiece, Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), SentencePiece
- Custom tokenizers for domain-specific models
- Tokenization speed & memory optimization

###  **3. Fine-Tuning Large Language Models**
- Fine-tuning **BERT for text classification**
- Fine-tuning **GPT models for text generation**
- Using **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** for efficient fine-tuning
- Dataset preparation for training LLMs

###  **4. Optimization & Performance Tuning**
- **Quantization (4-bit, 8-bit)** for reduced memory usage
- **PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning)** for fast adaptation
- **Model distillation** for making LLMs smaller & faster
- Running LLMs on **consumer GPUs** (No A100 required)

###  **5. Inference & API Development**
- Running **real-time inference** with Hugging Face models
- Creating an **LLM-powered chatbot**
- Serving models with **Flask & FastAPI**
- Using **ONNX** and **TensorRT** for faster inference

###  **6. LLM Deployment**
- Deploying models on **Hugging Face Spaces**
- Deploying on **AWS, GCP, and Azure**
- Running LLMs on **edge devices (Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano)**
